RELEASE - Please note: TiO2 was released in December 2010 with a slightly older
version of Titanium Appcelerator. TA has made lots of advances recently and
further testing and updates need to be done.

A basic example
---------------
Welcome to Titanium Compound (TiO2). TiO2 is a set of source code to make building form and data driven mobile applications easier to write.

Build dynamic, native (application and presentation) application in minutes.

Let me illustrate - here is a form with 3 fields, including a password which is checked and re-entered.

	var form = new TiO2.FormLayout.Default({items: [
		{ name: 'first', label: 'First name' },
		{ name: 'last', label: 'Last name' },
		{ name: 'password', type: 'Password', 'Password', retype: true },
	]});
